# Task Priority Decision Agent

A prompt-driven AI automation agent built using Turbotic AI Automation to intelligently prioritize tasks based on time availability, task difficulty, and user-defined constraints.

## Overview
This automation leverages Turbotic's AI agent framework to evaluate incoming tasks, score them, and generate an optimized work order. The workflow is powered entirely through prompt engineering, enabling dynamic decision-making without complex coding.

## Key Features
- Prioritizes tasks using time availability and difficulty scoring
- Fully prompt-based logic (no manual rule writing)
- Automatically recommends which task to do next
- Works with any structured or semi-structured task list
- Easy integration with existing workflows

## How It Works
1. The user provides tasks with metadata (duration, difficulty, deadlines).
2. Turbotic's AI agent processes the data through a custom prompt.
3. The agent outputs a sorted task list with recommended priorities.
4. Optional follow-up actions (email, notification, workflow triggers) can be included.

## Example Prompt Logic
The prompt evaluates tasks using:
- Duration matching to available time slots  
- Difficulty level weighting  
- Urgency and dependency considerations  
- Automatic scoring and priority ordering  

## Use Cases
- Daily task scheduling
- Personal productivity automation
- Team work allocation logic
- Smart workload balancing

## Future Enhancements
- Add scoring explanations for transparency
- Implement auto-updates based on task progress
- Integrate with calendars or project management tools
